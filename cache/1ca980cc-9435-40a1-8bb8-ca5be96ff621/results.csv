0,"Levy tipped for Whitbread prize
Novelist Andrea Levy is favourite to win the main Whitbread Prize book of the year award, after winning novel of the
year with her book Small Island.
The book has already won the Orange Prize for fiction, and is now 5/4 favourite for the Â£25,000 Whitbread. Second
favourite is a biography of Mary Queen of Scots, by John Guy. A panel of judges including Sir Trevor McDonald, actor
Hugh Grant and writer Joanne Harris will decide the overall winner on Tuesday.
The five writers in line for the award won their respective categories - first novel, novel, biography, poetry and children's
book - on 6 January. Small Island, Levy's fourth novel, is set in post-war London and centres on a landlady and her
lodgers. One is a Jamaican who joined British troops to fight Hitler but finds life difficult out of uniform when he settles in
the UK. ""What could have been a didactic or preachy prospect turns out to hilarious, moving humane and eye-popping.
It's hard to think of anybody not enjoying it,"" wrote the judges. The judges called Guy's My Heart is My Own: The Life of
Mary Queen of Scots ""an impressive and readable piece of scholarship, which cannot fail but leave the reader moved
and intrigued by this most tragic and likeable of queens"". Guy has published many histories, including one of Tudor
England. He is a fellow at Clare College, Cambridge and became a honorary research professor of the University of St
Andrews in 2003.
The other contenders include Susan Fletcher for Eve Green, which won the first novel prize. Fletcher has recently
graduated from the University of East Anglia's creative writing course. The fourth book in the running is Corpus, Michael
Symmons Roberts' fourth collection of poems. As well as writing poetry, Symmons Roberts also makes documentary
films. Geraldine McCaughrean is the final contender, having won the children's fiction category for the third time for Not
the End of the World. McCaughrean, who went into magazine publishing after studying teaching, previously won the
category in 1987 with A Little Lower than Angels and in 1994 with Gold Dust.",a_determiner

2,"Da Vinci Code is 'lousy history'
The plot of an international bestseller that thousands of readers are likely to receive as a Christmas present is
'laughable', a clergyman has said.
The Da Vinci Code claims Jesus was not crucified, but married Mary Magdalene and died a normal death. It claims this
was later covered up by the Church. The Bishop of Durham, the Rt Rev Dr Tom Wright, described the novel as a ""great
thriller"" but ""lousy history"". The book has sold more than seven million copies worldwide. Despite enjoying Dan Brown's
conspiracy theory, the Bishop said there was a lack of evidence to back up its claims.
Writing his Christmas message in the Northern Echo, the Bishop said: ""Conspiracy theories are always fun - fun to
invent, fun to read, fun to fantasise about. ""Dan Brown is the best writer I've come across in the genre, but anyone who
knows anything about 1st century history will see that this underlying material is laughable."" A great deal of credible
evidence proves the Biblical version of Jesus' life was true, according to the Bishop. ""The evidence for Jesus and the
origins of Christianity is astonishingly good,"" he said. ""We have literally a hundred times more early manuscripts for the
gospels and letters in the New Testament than we have for the main classical authors like Cicero, Virgil and Tacitus.
""Historical research shows that they present a coherent and thoroughly credible picture of Jesus, with all sorts of
incidental details that fit the time when he lived, and don't fit the world of later legend."" Brown's book has become a
publishing phenomenon, consistently topping book charts in the UK and US. The Da Vinci Code has been translated
into 42 languages and has spawned its own cottage industry of publications, including guides on to how to read the
book, rebuttals and counter claims. The book, which has become an international best-seller in little over two years, is
set to be made into a film starring Tom Hanks.",a_determiner
